# Here the Qns For the Task

# Task #1 - SpeedTest
These tasks are going to be about conditional statements. You can think of this as your level one tasks. 


You need to write a function that receives an argument. This argument is going to be our speed. If our speed meets a certain condition, it should return a certain string.

    If our speed is under 10 or equal - return slow
    If our speed is over 10 and up to 40 - return average
    If our speed is over 40 and is up to 100 - return fast
    If our speed is over 100 and up to 180 - return very fast
    If our speed is over 180 - return extremely fast
    
   
   
 # Task #2 - Bonus Score

    You will be given one number - your score. This score will get some bonus points if some conditions are met. You have to write a function which counts all the bonus points   which this score gets and return the new score (your score + bonus points)

        If the score is under 100 or equal, the bonus points are 10.
        If the score is over 100, the bonus points are 30% from the score.
        If the score is over 1000, the bonus points are 20% from the score.

    The extra bonus points(added after the previous bonus point are already applied):

        If the score is even, you get +4 bonus points.
        If the score ends on a 5, you get +5 bonus points.
